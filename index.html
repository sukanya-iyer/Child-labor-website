    <h2>What is child labor?</h2>
    <p>Child labor is defined as work that is mentally, physically, and socially harmful for children and may deprive them of their childhood and education. <br></br> Victims of child labor are often impoverished and use their small wages to support their families, though some are forced into it. Although most child labor occurs in agriculture, children can also be found working in other industries, such as manufacturing, mining, or worse. <br></br> </p>
