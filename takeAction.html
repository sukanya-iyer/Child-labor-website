    <p>Fast fashion is a method focused on mass-producing clothing at a cheap cost. Unfortunately, this means that the factories producing these clothes rely on cheap, unskilled labor, which often means using and mistreating child laborers. <br> </br>
      Some ways to becoming a more conscious consumer are to: 
      <div id="fastFashionBullets">
        <p class="firstBullets"> ◎ Buy secondhand clothing at thrift stores  </p>
        <br>
        <p class="firstBullets"> ◎ Focus on buying fashion staples rather than "trendy" clothes</p>
        <br>
        <p class="firstBullets"> ◎ If you invest in companies, make sure that you support places that don't use hazardous labor.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="firstBullets"> ◎ Research your brands!
